            <p>
                More voices of survivors are amplified by us on every social media platform. 1Palestine unifies all of the world who stand with Palestine to hand over the mic to Palestinians by allowing them to share their experiences so we may repost these stories to social media either anonymously or by their full names.  They have the right to tell their story in their own voice, own narrative, perspective, and most importantly, to decide for themselves.
